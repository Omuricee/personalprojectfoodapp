In order to run this, you need the latest version of node.js installed on your system.


You can start off by running:
npm run build

This will build the react app on your system and make your app ready to be deployed.


Then run:
### npm i react-scripts
and
### npm install


This will install react scripts which is another part of this app.

Lastly, run:
### npm start

This will open the app in a localhost:3000 and make your code viewable in the browser (please use chrome or some sort of chromium based browser).

Enjoy!
