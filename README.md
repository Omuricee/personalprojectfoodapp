# personalprojectfoodapp
In order to run this, you need the latest version of node.js installed on your system.

You will also need to create your own api key and ID in order to run the app. 

Head over to this website https://developer.edamam.com/admin and create a new Application. Retrieve your own APP_ID and APP_KEY

Once this is done, create a new .env file in your folder and add these two lines

### REACT_APP_ID="your own app id"
### REACT_APP_KEY="your own app key"

Save all changes and then start the building of the app


You can start off by running:
npm run build

This will build the react app on your system and make your app ready to be deployed.


Then run:
### npm i react-scripts
and
### npm install


This will install react scripts which is another part of this app.

Lastly, run:
### npm start

This will open the app in a localhost:3000 and make your code viewable in the browser (please use chrome or some sort of chromium based browser).

Enjoy!
